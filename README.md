# mayamdai

Maya client library for MayaEngine

This library supports both Web Socket as well as HTTP modes for communication.

## Installation

npm:

```sh
npm install --save mayamdai
npm install --save-dev mayaengine-types
```

yarn:

```sh
yarn add mayamdai
yarn add --dev mayaengine-types
```

## Web Socket

Example:

```typescript
import { connect, request, close } from "mayamdai";
import type { ApiParams } from "mayaengine-types";

const WSS_API_URL = "wss://mayaengine.mayamd.ai";
const MAYA_ENGINE_API_KEY = "<your API key>";
const MAYA_ENGINE_API_SECRET = "<your API secret>";

const run = async () => {
  try {
    await connect(WSS_API_URL, MAYA_ENGINE_API_KEY, MAYA_ENGINE_API_SECRET);
    const params: ApiParams = {
      requestType: "searchSymptom",
      term: "head",
    };
    const output = await request(params);
    console.log("OUTPUT:", output);
    await close();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("ERROR:", ERROR);
  }
}

run();
```

## HTTP

Example 1 (direct HTTP request):

```typescript
import { requestHttp } from "mayamdai";
import type { ApiParams } from "mayaengine-types";

const HTTPS_API_URL = "https://mayaengine.mayamd.ai";
const MAYA_ENGINE_API_KEY = "<your API key>";
const MAYA_ENGINE_API_SECRET = "<your API secret>";

const run = async () => {
  try {
    const params: ApiParams = {
      apiKey: MAYA_ENGINE_API_KEY,
      apiSecret: MAYA_ENGINE_API_SECRET
      requestType: "searchSymptom",
      term: "head",
    };
    const output = await requestHttp(params, HTTPS_API_URL);
    console.log("OUTPUT:", output);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("ERROR:", ERROR);
  }
}

run();
```

Example 2 (similar to web socket):

```typescript
import { connect, request, close } from "mayamdai";
import type { ApiParams } from "mayaengine-types";

const HTTPS_API_URL = "https://mayaengine.mayamd.ai";
const MAYA_ENGINE_API_KEY = "<your API key>";
const MAYA_ENGINE_API_SECRET = "<your API secret>";

const run = async () => {
  try {
    await connect(HTTPS_API_URL, MAYA_ENGINE_API_KEY, MAYA_ENGINE_API_SECRET);
    const params: ApiParams = {
      requestType: "searchSymptom",
      term: "head",
    };
    const output = await request(params);
    console.log("OUTPUT:", output);
    await close();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("ERROR:", ERROR);
  }
}

run();
```

15. noop - no operation, just returns a success result. Used by the client library to verify authentication in HTTP mode.

## Events

Currently there are events only for the web socket connection, although connect returns an event emitter in either case.

1. partial - emitted when a partial output is received. Only one parameter of type ApiOutput.

2. socketError - emitted when a socket error occurs. Only one parameter of type Error.

3. socketClose - emitted when the socket is closed. No parameter.

4. socketOpen - emitted when the socket is opened. Note: Initial socket open will not emit this because the connect function will resolve only after successful authentication.

## Partial Outputs (only on web socket connection)

The connect function returns an event emitter. For partial responses after the first part, listen on 'partial' event. Partial can be used for responsiveness when the network is slow and/or the data is huge, so that the output can be incrementally rendered to the user before the whole data is received.

Example:

```typescript
import { connect, request, close } from "mayamdai";
import type { ApiParams } from "mayaengine-types";

const WSS_API_URL = "wss://mayaengine.mayamd.ai";
const MAYA_ENGINE_API_KEY = "<your API key>";
const MAYA_ENGINE_API_SECRET = "<your API secret>";

const run = async () => {
  try {
    const mayamdai = await connect(WSS_API_URL, MAYA_ENGINE_API_KEY, MAYA_ENGINE_API_SECRET);
    mayamdai.on('partial', (output) => {
      console.log("Additional partial output:", output);
    })
    const params: ApiParams = {
        requestType: "analyze",
        partial: true,
        layperson: true,
        algorithm: false,
        excludingSex: "F",
        input: {
          age: 45,
          sex: "male",
          countryName: "US",
          symptoms: [{ id: 7704, duration: 14, qualifiers: [87] }],
          contexts: [12],
          negativeContexts: [15],
        },
      };
    const output = await request(params);
    console.log("Initial OUTPUT:", output);
    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 2000)); // wait for 2 seconds
    await close();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("ERROR:", ERROR);
  }
}

run();
```
